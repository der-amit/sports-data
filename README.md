# sports-data
## I've tried to analyse sports data and draw inferences and/or make predictions.

The first code uses linear regression to predict the minutes based on the age. 
There are obvious limitations in this code as linear regression uses a straight line to make the prediction.
So the higher age gets, the more minutes a player will play, which isn't the case in real life.

The second code is more accurate as it uses polynomial regression to make a prediction. So there is a turning point after which the older a player gets,
the fewer minutes they will play. This comes from the quadratic equation.
